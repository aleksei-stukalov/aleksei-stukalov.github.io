    <main class="blog__main">
      <h2>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h2>
      <p>
        Physical wellbeing is super important for keeping my energy up and my
        mind sharp, especially with all the focus coding requires. I already do
        a fair bit to keep myself moving and will continue working on this as
        part of my daily routine. I walk most days, often heading to the local
        coffee shop and back, which helps me reset. I also enjoy short walks to
        the shops, as they give me a little break from the screen. Occasionally,
        I plan to take my mom's dog for an evening walk to de-stress after a
        long day of work and study. Sleep is another non-negotiable; I'll aim
        for 7 hours a night to ensure I'm rested and ready for whatever
        challenges come my way.
      </p>

      <h2>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</h2>
      <p>
        For me, whanau isn't just about immediate family; it's about the people
        I share my life with. I prioritize having lunch and dinner every day
        with my partner, who I'm building my life with here in New Zealand. This
        daily connection allows us to support each other and stay close. I also
        aim to have weekly dinners with either my partner's family or my mom, as
        these gatherings help strengthen our bonds. Additionally, at Dev Academy
        and beyond, I'm committed to engaging with my peers, checking in with
        one another, and offering support when things get tough, knowing that
        this collective effort helps everyone stay on track.
      </p>

      <h2>Taha Hinengaro (Mental & Emotional Wellbeing)</h2>
      <p>
        Mental and emotional wellbeing is key to long-term success, especially
        in a challenging field like web development. I'm already making efforts
        to support my mental health and will continue to focus on it. For
        instance, I plan to spend 10 minutes each night doing guided meditation
        or deep breathing exercises to unwind after a long day of learning and
        coding. I'm also working on setting clear boundaries regarding work,
        study, and life to prevent burnout, which means no late-night coding
        marathons unless absolutely necessary, and making time for non-tech
        activities that help me recharge mentally.
      </p>

      <h2>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h2>
      <p>
        For me, taha wairua is about staying connected to my purpose and values,
        which give meaning to the work I do. I plan to take time each week to
        reflect on why I'm pursuing my goals and how they align with my bigger
        aspirations. Practicing gratitude daily is also important; I want to
        appreciate small wins, like finally fixing a tricky bug, and recognize
        the supportive people in my life. This practice helps me stay positive
        and connected to what matters most.
      </p>

      <h2>Whenua (Connection to the Land and Environment)</h2>
      <p>
        Living in New Zealand while being far from my homeland adds a
        significant layer to my understanding of whenua. Keeping that connection
        alive is really important to me, and visiting my home country in June
        with my partner was a special experience that reinforced my ties to
        where I come from. I love having little souvenirs from home — items that
        remind me of my roots and keep me connected to my culture. Even when I'm
        miles away, feeling that connection to the motherland is grounding, so I
        plan to take moments each week to walk barefoot on the grass. On nice
        days, I'll also take my laptop outside and code in the fresh air,
        blending nature with work to feel more connected to my surroundings.
