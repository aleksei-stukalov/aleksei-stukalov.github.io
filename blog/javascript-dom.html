      <h2>A Simple Breakdown</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript is one of those programming languages that, when you start
        out, seems like a mountain to climb. When I first began learning about
        it, along with HTML and CSS, it felt overwhelming. But as I've gone
        deeper, I've found ways to explain these concepts in simple terms.
        Hopefully, by the end of this post, you'll have a clearer idea of what
        JavaScript is, how it interacts with HTML and CSS, and some of its key
        features.
      </p>

      <h2>JavaScript, HTML, and CSS: How They Work Together</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine you're building a house. HTML is the structure—the walls, doors,
        and windows—basically, the blueprint of your website. CSS is the paint,
        the design, the interior decoration that makes the house look nice.
        JavaScript? It's the electricity running through the house. It makes
        things happen, brings the space to life, like turning on lights or
        opening doors when you click them. HTML sets up the content, CSS makes
        it visually appealing, and JavaScript brings the interactivity.
      </p>

      <h2>Control Flow and Loops: A Real-World Example</h2>
      <p>
        In programming, control flow is simply the order in which code runs. To
        put it simply, it's like following instructions step-by-step, one after
        another. But sometimes, you don't want to follow every step in order—you
        need to make decisions. That's where conditions and loops come in.
      </p>
      <p>Let's take an example from real life. Imagine you're doing laundry.</p>

      <!-- Need to work on these styles -->
      <ol>
        <li>Start the washing machine.</li>
        <li>
          Check if the clothes are clean. If they are, move to the next step. If
          not, run the wash cycle again.
        </li>
        <li>Once the clothes are clean, move them to the dryer.</li>
        <li>
          Check if they're dry. If yes, take them out. If not, keep drying.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        In code, this is handled by control flow, using if/else conditions and
        loops (like running the washing cycle again). A loop helps you repeat
        actions—like checking if clothes are dry—until a specific condition is
        met.
      </p>

      <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>
      <p>
        The DOM (Document Object Model) is basically a live map of your website.
        It represents all the elements on the webpage—text, images, buttons,
        etc.—in a structure that JavaScript can manipulate. Think of it like a
        digital model of your house that JavaScript can interact with, without
        having to knock down and rebuild the house itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, you can use JavaScript to interact with the DOM and make
        changes on your website. Let's say you want to change the text on a
        button when someone clicks on it. Instead of manually altering the HTML
        file, JavaScript allows you to modify the DOM, making the update right
        there on the screen without changing the original structure.
      </p>

      <h2>Arrays vs Objects: Accessing Data</h2>
      <p>
        In JavaScript, you've got two common ways to store data: arrays and
        objects.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Arrays are like numbered shelves in a library. Each shelf has a book,
          and each book is in a specific order. To get a book, you just need to
          know which shelf it's on, starting from 0. For example, if you have an
          array like
          <span class="blog__focused">['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']</span>, and
          you want the second fruit, you'd use
          <span class="blog__focused">array[1]</span> to get
          <span class="blog__focused">‘banana'</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Objects, on the other hand, are like a filing cabinet where each
          drawer has a label. Instead of numbers, you use keys (names) to find
          the data you need. For example, if you have an object like
          <span class="blog__focused">{name: 'John', age: 25}</span>, you'd
          access the age by using
          <span class="blog__focused">object.age</span> or
          <span class="blog__focused">object['age']</span>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The key difference is that arrays are ordered by index, while objects
        are more like named properties.
      </p>

      <h2>What are Functions and Why Are They Useful?</h2>
      <p>
        Functions are like little machines that do specific tasks. Think of them
        as a recipe in a cookbook. Instead of writing down the steps to make a
        dish every time, you write it once, give it a name, and refer to it
        whenever you need to make that dish again.
      </p>
      <p>
        In JavaScript, functions allow you to package up chunks of code that you
        can use repeatedly, whenever you need them. This helps keep your code
        clean, organized, and easy to maintain. It's way more efficient than
        copying and pasting the same logic over and over.
      </p>
      <p>For example, you could have a function that adds two numbers:</p>

      <div class="blog__code">
        <pre><code>function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}</code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Now, anytime you need to add two numbers, you just call the add
        function, and it'll take care of the rest.
      </p>

      <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
      <p>
        At first glance, JavaScript can seem like a lot to take in. But when you
        break it down into smaller, digestible concepts, it starts to make a lot
        more sense. HTML builds the structure, CSS styles it, and JavaScript
        brings it all to life. Control flow, loops, DOM manipulation, arrays,
        objects, and functions are all fundamental pieces that help make your
        website dynamic, interactive, and smart.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope this post gives you a clearer idea of how all these pieces fit
        together!
