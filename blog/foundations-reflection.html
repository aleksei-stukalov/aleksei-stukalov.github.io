      <h1>Human Skills Reflection: A Journey of Growth</h1>
    </header>

    <main class="blog__main">
      <p>
        As I reach the final sprint of my Foundations curriculum, I find myself
        reflecting on the journey that has shaped my understanding of not only
        web development but also of myself. The Human Skills component of
        Foundations has been one of the most surprising and enriching parts of
        the learning process. While it may seem unusual for a programming course
        to focus on these skills, it's become clear that the ability to code
        isn't the only requirement for success in the tech industry. Through a
        series of activities and reflections, I've gained valuable insights into
        my own identity, values, and emotional intelligence, all of which are
        essential for my growth as a developer and team member.
      </p>

      <h2>What Surprised Me About Human Skills Learning</h2>
      <p>
        The most surprising aspect of Human Skills learning is how relevant it
        is to becoming a well-rounded developer. I came into this program
        expecting to focus purely on technical skills like JavaScript, HTML, and
        CSS. However, through activities like identity and values exploration,
        emotional intelligence exercises, and discussions about neuroplasticity,
        I've learned that understanding myself and how I relate to others is
        just as important as my ability to code. The fact that employers in the
        tech industry highly value these skills shows that coding is only one
        part of the equation. The rest comes down to how you collaborate,
        communicate, and solve problems in a team environment.
      </p>

      <h2>Three New Things I've Learned About Myself and My Ego</h2>
      <p>
        1. <strong>Self-Awareness Matters:</strong> I've realized how crucial
        self-awareness is in managing my ego during challenging situations. I've
        often been quick to judge myself or others when facing difficulties, but
        through Human Skills training, I've learned to pause and reflect. I can
        now better recognize my triggers and emotional responses, which helps me
        approach problems with a clearer mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. <strong>The Importance of Active Listening:</strong> Before starting
        Foundations, I wasn't fully aware of how often I listened with the
        intent to reply, rather than to understand. Through techniques like
        “Listening and Looping,” I've learned the power of active listening,
        which has improved both my communication skills and my relationships
        with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. <strong>Balancing Confidence and Humility:</strong> The human skills
        curriculum has taught me the importance of balancing confidence in my
        abilities with humility. I've learned that it's okay to ask for help and
        that doing so doesn't diminish my value as a developer. It's actually a
        strength that promotes growth.
      </p>

      <h2>
        The Role of Values, Empathy, and Self-Awareness in Learning and
        Programming
      </h2>
      <p>
        Values, empathy, and self-awareness are the foundation of effective
        teamwork and learning in the tech industry. Values guide our decisions,
        empathy allows us to understand and collaborate with others, and
        self-awareness helps us manage our emotions and reactions in a
        productive way. In programming, these qualities enable us to approach
        challenges with an open mind and to work harmoniously with others, which
        is key when developing projects as part of a team. Whether it's
        understanding a teammate's perspective or reflecting on my own strengths
        and limitations, these human skills are essential for long-term success
        in a programming career.
      </p>

      <h2>The Most Challenging Aspects of Human Skills Learning</h2>
      <p>
        The most challenging aspect for me was the self-reflection exercises.
        It's easy to code and debug logical problems, but turning inward and
        reflecting on my own emotions, values, and reactions is much harder. The
        journaling exercises and reflections required me to confront parts of
        myself I hadn't fully acknowledged before, such as my tendencies toward
        perfectionism or my reluctance to ask for help when I need it. These
        moments of reflection were uncomfortable at times, but ultimately
        they've been some of the most valuable moments in the course.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Why Do We Focus So Much on Human Skills in a Web Development Bootcamp?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The reason we focus on Human Skills is that technical ability alone
        doesn't make you a great developer. Employers are looking for people who
        not only know how to code but who can collaborate effectively,
        communicate clearly, and adapt to change. Web development is rarely a
        solo endeavor—it's about teamwork, and having strong human skills
        ensures that you can work well in a diverse team. It's also about
        developing the emotional resilience to handle the inevitable setbacks
        and challenges that come with coding. By focusing on human skills, the
        bootcamp is preparing us to not only be competent developers but also to
        be valuable, adaptable, and compassionate team members.
      </p>

      <h2>Was Human Skills Learning a Waste of Time?</h2>
      <p>
        Far from being a waste of time, the human skills component has been
        crucial to my development as a web developer. While it may be tempting
        to think that time spent reflecting on my identity or practicing empathy
        would be better spent coding, the reality is that these skills are
        directly transferable to the work environment. A developer who can
        manage their emotions, communicate effectively, and work well with
        others will always outperform one who focuses solely on technical
        ability. Learning to code is important, but learning how to work with
        others and understand oneself is what truly sets a developer apart.
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion, the Human Skills component of the Foundations curriculum
        has been an eye-opening experience. It has equipped me with tools to not
        only navigate the technical challenges of web development but also to
        approach my career with empathy, resilience, and self-awareness. These
        skills will undoubtedly play a critical role as I move forward into the
        bootcamp and, eventually, into the tech industry.
