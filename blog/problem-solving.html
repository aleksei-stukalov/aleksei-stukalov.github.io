      <h2>Blocked by the Simplest Problem</h2>
      <p>
        A while ago, I was working on an authentication logic for a backend Nuxt
        server, trying to get OAuth authentication set up. Everything seemed
        straightforward at first, but I kept getting errors saying that my
        challenge and verifier keys didn't match on the server. No matter how
        many times I rewrote the code, adjusted the logic, or tried different
        key generation methods, the error persisted. I spent the entire day
        beating my head against this issue, convinced I was missing something
        obvious. But as the day wore on, I realized I wasn't going to fix it
        that day.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next morning, I approached it differently. I sat down, took a
        breath, and drew a flow diagram of the entire authentication process.
        That's when it hit me—the problem wasn't in the code itself but in how
        the flow was handled. Every time the OAuth process redirected to the
        third-party service, my key generator was creating a new
        challenge/verifier pair. Essentially, it was resetting on each request,
        which meant that by the time the verifier came back for validation, it
        didn't match the original challenge. Once I spotted that flaw in the
        flow, I adjusted the logic to store the challenge/verifier pair properly
        across requests, and boom—problem solved!
      </p>
      <p>
        I felt a massive sense of relief and a bit of pride after figuring it
        out. I learned that sometimes, when you're stuck, the issue might not be
        in the code but in how you're thinking about the problem. Stepping back
        to visualize the flow or logic can make all the difference.
      </p>

      <h2>Elegantly Solving a Problem</h2>
      <p>
        On the more satisfying side of things, I recently created a theme styles
        toggler for the very blog you're reading right now. I wanted users to be
        able to switch between a light and dark mode seamlessly, without loading
        new stylesheets or causing a page reload. After considering a few
        different approaches, I decided to use CSS variables and toggle a
        data-theme attribute on the body element.
      </p>
      <p>
        The process was simple yet elegant. I broke everything down into smaller
        problems: First, I defined my CSS variables for the colors and styles I
        wanted to change. Then, I wrote a small JavaScript function that would
        toggle the data-theme attribute on the body tag. This attribute
        controlled which set of CSS variables to apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each step was straightforward, and since I took the time to break it
        into manageable chunks, the entire thing worked on the first try! It
        felt great to see how smoothly the theme toggled and how clean the
        solution was. I learned that solving complex problems is often just a
        matter of breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps. One step at
        a time.
      </p>

      <h2>Reflecting on Problem-Solving Techniques</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="blog__bold">Pseudocode</span>: I feel confident with
        pseudocode. It's like drafting out your battle plan before diving into
        the code. It helps me organize my thoughts and keep track of each step.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="blog__bold">Trying Something</span>: Definitely one of my
        most used methods. Sometimes just writing a quick test or random snippet
        of code gets the ideas flowing and helps me uncover the solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="blog__bold">Rubber Ducky Method</span>: I haven't used this
        much yet, but I can see how talking through the problem (even if it's to
        a rubber duck) would help clarify what's going on. It's something I want
        to try more often.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="blog__bold">Reading Error Messages</span>: This has become
        second nature. At first, I used to panic when I saw a giant error
        message in the console, but now I've learned to look at the details and
        figure out what it's telling me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="blog__bold">Console.logging</span>: My best friend in
        coding. Console logs help me trace what's happening inside my code, and
        I always feel confident using them to debug.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="blog__bold">Googling</span>: A skill in its own right! I
        feel confident in my ability to search for solutions. There's usually
        someone else who has already encountered the same problem, and Google
        often leads me to the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="blog__bold">Asking Peers for Help</span>: I'm getting
        better at this. It's easy to want to solve everything on your own, but
        sometimes a fresh set of eyes can see what you can't.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="blog__bold">Asking Coaches for Help</span>: I still
        hesitate sometimes, thinking I should figure it out myself, but I know
        they're here to help. I'm working on being more proactive in reaching
        out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="blog__bold">Improving Your Process with Reflection</span>:
        I'm starting to embrace reflection more. Taking time to think about what
        worked and what didn't helps me refine my approach and avoid repeating
        the same mistakes.
      </p>

      <h2>A Time I Was Reluctant to Ask for Help</h2>
      <p>
        About a year ago, I was working on a website, and I ran into a
        JavaScript issue. I was trying to implement a feature that worked fine
        in most browsers, but for some reason, it was breaking in Safari. I
        spent hours tinkering with my code, convinced that I could solve it on
        my own. I kept debugging, searching for clues, but the problem
        persisted.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was reluctant to ask for help because I felt like I should be able to
        figure it out, especially since the issue seemed so simple. But
        eventually, after wasting a lot of time, I gave in and asked for help on
        a Discord channel. Within minutes, someone responded and pointed out
        that the JavaScript function I was using wasn't supported in Safari on
        macOS. That was it—a simple compatibility issue. All that stress and
        time spent when I could've just asked sooner!
      </p>
      <p>
        Next time, I'll definitely ask for help earlier. What I learned from
        that experience is that no matter how experienced you are, you don't
        have to solve everything on your own. Sometimes asking for help is the
        quickest way to move forward. Plus, the development community is super
        supportive, and there's no shame in reaching out.
