      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        To become a Full Stack Web Developer and eventually move toward a Team
        Leading role, where I could manage a small team focused on developing
        new tools or technologies. I want to grow not just as a developer but
        also as a leader, helping guide a team through challenges and shaping
        innovative projects.
      </p>

      <h2>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h2>
      <p>
        My biggest strength when it comes to learning is definitely my
        curiosity. I genuinely enjoy exploring new topics and diving deep into
        things that catch my interest. This helps me stay motivated, especially
        when I'm learning something challenging or unfamiliar. I tend to take
        the initiative to look beyond the immediate material and discover more,
        which often leads me to unexpected insights or solutions. <br />
        On the flip side, one of my limitations is a lack of discipline. I
        sometimes struggle to get started on tasks, especially when they feel
        repetitive or unexciting. My tendency to seek out new experiences can
        cause me to lose focus on the fundamentals or tasks that require
        patience. But I believe with enough practice, I can improve my
        discipline and find ways to balance my excitement with consistency in my
        learning.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        One of the key skills I'd like to develop at Dev Academy is better
        communication, especially when working with teams. I want to get better
        at clearly expressing my ideas and collaborating more effectively with
        others, whether it's during problem-solving or just day-to-day
        interactions. <br />Additionally, I want to build greater discipline.
        since I struggle sometimes with it, so developing a stronger sense of
        discipline would help me stay consistent and productive.
      </p>

      <h2>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include:
      </h2>
      <p>
        <span class="blog__italic">
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
          and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
          representatives </span
        ><br />
        Open and respectful communication with fellow learners, facilitators and
        representatives is the key. I plan to actively participate in group
        activities, offer constructive feedback, and be receptive to others
        ideas. I will follow professional standards and guidelines when
        interacting with others, maintaining a focus on mutual respect and
        safety. This collaborative spirit will help create a productive and
        supportive learning environment I believe.<br />
        <span class="blog__italic">
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
          you</span
        ><br />
        I am already beginning each week by setting clear goals and creating a
        schedule. Prioritising tasks based on how familiar I am with the topic.
        It's helping me stay organised and focused.<br />
        When things start to build up and become overwhelming, I will take
        proactive steps to address the situation. This includes breaking down
        tasks into smaller, manageable steps and seeking help or advice from
        peers or facilitators. I will also incorporate regular breaks and
        self-care practices into my routine to manage stress effectively.
      </p>

      <h2>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h2>
      <p>
        I'm confident in utilizing the well-organized Discord server, which is
        full of knowledgeable individuals ready to assist. In addition to this,
        I plan to extensively use search engines and tap into various web
        development community resources. I'll make sure to leverage all
        available tools and platforms to get the support I need promptly.
      </p>

      <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
      <p>
        I expect the Facilitation team to provide mentoring and keep me focused.
        It's easy for me to get sidetracked and lost in details, so guidance on
        when a feature is genuinely valuable versus when it's just an
        overemphasis on my part would be incredibly helpful.<br />
        Additionally, I'm looking for opportunities to connect with the
        real-world IT community. I hope the team can facilitate networking and
        involvement that could expose me to career opportunities and potentially
        make finding employment easier.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Currently, I have two part-time jobs, but they will both conclude by the
        start of October, right when the bootcamp begins. Instead, I will be
        taking on a small part-time website project with very limited hours per
        week to maintain a bit of income. Aside from that, there will be no
        block-out times affecting my schedule.
