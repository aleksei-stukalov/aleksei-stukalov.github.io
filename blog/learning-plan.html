      <h2>Long-Term Goals and Career Pathway</h2>
      <p>
        My long-term goal is to become a Full Stack Web Developer and eventually
        transition into a Team Lead role, where I can manage a small team
        focused on developing new tools and technologies. I want to grow not
        only as a developer but also as a leader, helping guide a team through
        challenges and shaping innovative projects. Leadership is something I
        aim to cultivate, and I'm excited about balancing the technical side of
        things with managing people and processes.
      </p>

      <h2>Strengths and Limitations in Learning</h2>
      <p>
        One of my biggest strengths is curiosity. I have a natural drive to
        explore new topics and dive deep into anything that piques my interest.
        This sense of curiosity has always kept me motivated, especially when
        working through unfamiliar or challenging material. I find joy in
        digging deeper into subjects, which often leads me to valuable insights
        or solutions that I might not have initially considered.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, a limitation I've recognized in myself is a lack of discipline.
        While curiosity drives me, it can also distract me. I sometimes struggle
        with starting tasks, especially when they are repetitive or feel less
        exciting. When I lose focus, it's often because I'm drawn toward new
        experiences or material instead of staying consistent with the
        fundamentals. I believe that through Bootcamp, I can develop the
        discipline I need by practicing consistency and maintaining focus on
        both exciting and routine tasks.
      </p>

      <h2>Non-Technical Skills I Want to Develop</h2>
      <p>
        One of the human skills I'd like to focus on during my time at Dev
        Academy is improving my communication, particularly when it comes to
        teamwork. I want to become more effective at articulating my ideas
        clearly and collaborating smoothly with others, both in problem-solving
        and general interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I want to strengthen my discipline. This ties into my
        limitation around focus and consistency, and I believe that a structured
        environment like Bootcamp will help me develop the habits necessary to
        manage my time and tasks efficiently.
      </p>

      <h2>Managing My Workload</h2>
      <p>
        To manage my workload effectively, I commit to being open and respectful
        in my communications with other learners, facilitators, and industry
        representatives. Active participation in group activities will be a
        priority for me, offering constructive feedback and being receptive to
        the ideas of others. I plan to uphold professional standards in all my
        interactions, ensuring mutual respect and maintaining a safe and
        productive learning environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        I will begin each week by setting clear goals and creating a structured
        schedule, prioritizing tasks based on how familiar or challenging I find
        the subject. When I start to feel overwhelmed, my approach will be to
        break down tasks into smaller, manageable steps and seek guidance from
        peers or facilitators as needed. Incorporating regular breaks and
        practicing self-care will also be key to managing stress and staying
        productive.
      </p>

      <h2>Seeking Help in a Timely Manner</h2>
      <p>
        In terms of seeking help, I'm confident that I can utilize our
        well-structured Discord channels to ask questions or get support. The
        online development community is an incredible resource that I plan to
        tap into regularly. I will continue to use search engines and online
        forums to find solutions when I hit roadblocks. However, I also commit
        to not hesitating when I need to reach out for help from facilitators
        and fellow learnersâ€”asking for help in a timely manner will be critical
        for keeping my momentum.
      </p>

      <h2>Expectations from the Facilitation Team</h2>
      <p>
        I expect the Facilitation team to play a key role in mentoring and
        helping me stay on track. I tend to get lost in the details of my work
        sometimes, so I hope the facilitators can guide me in distinguishing
        what features or elements are truly valuable and when I'm
        overemphasizing something less important. This kind of feedback will
        help me balance my perfectionism with the realities of project timelines
        and deliverables.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I'm looking for the team to provide opportunities for
        connecting with the broader IT community. Being able to network and
        engage with real-world opportunities will be invaluable, both for
        learning and for potential employment prospects.
      </p>

      <h2>Scheduling Commitments</h2>
      <p>
        At the moment, I have no significant scheduling conflicts. I'm wrapping
        up two part-time jobs by the beginning of October, just in time for
        Bootcamp. Moving forward, I'll only be working on a small part-time
        website project that requires limited hours each week. This will allow
        me to focus nearly all my energy on Bootcamp, ensuring I can commit
        fully to my learning and growth.
