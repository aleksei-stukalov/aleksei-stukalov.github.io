      <h2>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am not sure how much choice I had in that situation, and even if it
        can be consider “ethical”, but at my previous employment at a Tech
        company I was hired for a newely picked up contract by the company, it
        was for a web platform project and was for a long development time and a
        high budget, but when I started I have quickly realised that I was not a
        right person for the job, since I only had under a year of the
        programming experience and the job was for either a team of developers
        with similar experience as mine or for for a super-duper smart senior
        programmer. So I was in the situation to either keep myself busy working
        and hoping to get enough knowledge to make the project work (and that
        would be a big gamble) or be honest with the employer and explain them
        that they are not going to get by with only one developer. Maybe the
        fact that there was a huge probability that the project would be
        unfinished and not ideal at the end, has influenced my decision, but I
        became to be clear and honest about the difficulties and struggles with
        time on each meeting The company realised at the end that they won't be
        able to save on the dev team, and unfortunately had to drop the
        contract, and with that I lost my job, since that was the contract I got
        hired for.. which is fine, at least no client got screwed over and no
        team got to the situation where they are blamed.

      <h2>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I think the biggest thing that influences me from my culture is the
        community driven behavior rules. It is a very common thing in
        commune-like cultures, where people live close to each other (family,
        neighbours, nation), where it is very important to act and behave the
        way it is expected. Even if its controversial and I am not always agree
        with this cultural aspect, it is definitely still is in my personal
        culture and influencing my life.

      <h2>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h2>
      <p>
        My biggest strength is Curiosity. I think it is a great support for this
        study, since I am getting with the preexisting knowledge and experience,
        my curiosity allows me to take up a challenge and step a little bit
        further, expend my skills and discover new things.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h2>
      <p>
        One of my main limitations is a lack of discipline. I tend to seek
        excitement and novelty, which makes it hard for me to start tasks,
        especially if they feel repetitive or unchallenging. As a Peacock
        personality type, I thrive on new experiences, but this can lead to
        losing focus on foundational tasks. That said, my curiosity drives me to
        explore and learn, which helps me stay motivated. With enough practice
        and effort, I believe I can improve my discipline and push through those
        slower, less exciting parts of the learning process.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Back in the days when I was doing some labor jobs I was working at a
        transport company and we had few very stubborn and lazy workers. The
        problem was that the job load was set in stone and it had to be done, so
        when someone was putting much less work into the job, that meant that
        the rest had to work harder. At the time, I tried to address this by
        speaking up during our team meetings and encouraging everyone to step up
        their efforts. I thought direct communication might solve the issue, but
        it didn't have much impact. The workers continued their behavior, and
        the frustration in the team only grew. <br />
        Looking back, I think a different approach might have been more
        effective. Instead of confronting the issue head-on, I could have taken
        a more collaborative route, maybe suggesting we divide the work more
        fairly or rotate tasks so that no one felt like they were being singled
        out.
